                With 30 years of experience, Aaron is an invaluable resource in
                the Vancouver Island bagpiping scene. He has recently competed
                provincially as a solo bagpiper at the grade 2 level and has
                been the bagpiper for the Celtic Punk band{" "}

                for almost 9 years. If you're looking for a versatile bagpiper,
                Aaron is your guy! His passion for bagpiping has also led him to
                play the Irish whistle, where he has become a sought-after
                performer. Together with his wife, he hosts a weekly Traditional
                Irish Music Session in their hometown of Nanaimo, BC.

                After taking a few years off from competing, Aaron competed
                again in 2025 in the Pacific Northwest Competition
                Circuit securing a 4th place finish overall in the Grade 2 solo
                Bagpiping category. In addition to this, he won the Aggregate
                award for Grade 2 Solo Piping at the BC Pipers' Association Mini
                Gathering. Reconnecting with the competition scene has reignited
                his enthusiasm, and he looks forward to continuing next year.

                In addition to solo competitions, Aaron has competed with pipe
                and drum bands, performed at numerous special occasions
                (including his own wedding), and even played his bagpipes at the
                Ring of Brodgar in the Orkney Islands. As a teenager, he
                traveled to Scotland with his long time bagpipe instructor, Bill
                Grant, and competed in solo competition. He cherishes his early
                years with Legion Branch 53 Duncan Pipes and Drums, where he
                enjoyed listening to the war veterans' stories.

                Aaron's polished playing and remarkable technical mastery can be
                attributed to his instructors Carol Fowler, Bill Grant, Angus G.
                MacLeod, and James Barrie, many of whom were trained by
                legendary bagpipers in Scotland.

                Aaron has recently rekindled his passion for teaching bagpipes,
                a role he first embraced as a teenager with the Legion Pipe
                band. He finds great joy in instructing and watching his
                students grow and evolve.
